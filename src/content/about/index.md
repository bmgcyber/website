I've spent the last 9 years focused exclusively on offensive cybersecurity. I've ethically
hacked organizations from local small businesses to Fortune 10 enterprises across a range of
compliance environments. My work delivers clear, actionable guidance that cuts through IT
noise and meaningfully reduces risk. I'm always exploring frontier technologies, with a
current heavy focus on securing AI deployment and usage.
